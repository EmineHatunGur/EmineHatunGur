# 👋 Hi, 

I’m a **Backend Developer** with hands-on experience in building scalable, maintainable, and production-ready systems.  
My main focus is on **Python-based backend development**, distributed systems, and modern infrastructure tools.

Currently, I’m expanding my knowledge in **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and exploring how AI-powered solutions can be integrated into real-world backend architectures.
